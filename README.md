## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Description

**Table:** `orders`

| Column      | Type           | Description                         |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| order_id    | INT (AUTO_INCREMENT) | Unique ID for each order         |
| order_date  | DATE           | Date the order was placed           |
| product_id  | INT            | Product identifier (100‚Äì120)        |
| amount      | DECIMAL(10, 2) | Order revenue amount (‚Çπ50‚Äì‚Çπ1000)    |

A total of **500 records** were inserted with randomized data values across the year **2023**.

## üß± Schema & Data Generation Script

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_date DATE,
    product_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert 500 random orders
INSERT INTO orders (order_date, product_id, amount)
SELECT
    DATE_ADD('2023-01-01', INTERVAL FLOOR(RAND() * 365) DAY) AS order_date,
    FLOOR(100 + RAND() * 20) AS product_id,
    ROUND(50 + RAND() * 950, 2) AS amount
FROM
    (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5
     UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 10) AS t1
CROSS JOIN
    (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5
     UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 10) AS t2
CROSS JOIN
    (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5) AS t3
LIMIT 500;


##  Step 2: Run the Sales Trend Analysis Query

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    order_year, order_month
ORDER BY
    order_year, order_month;
```

### üìà Output Description

**Schema (MySQL v8)**

    -- Create orders table
    CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        order_date DATE,
        product_id INT,
        amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    
    -- Insert 500 rows using cross join of three derived tables with distinct aliases
    INSERT INTO orders (order_date, product_id, amount)
    SELECT
        DATE_ADD('2023-01-01', INTERVAL FLOOR(RAND() * 365) DAY) AS order_date,
        FLOOR(100 + RAND() * 20) AS product_id,   -- product ids between 100 and 120
        ROUND(50 + RAND() * 950, 2) AS amount     -- amounts between 50 and 1000
    FROM
        (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5
         UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 10) AS t1
    CROSS JOIN
        (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5
         UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 10) AS t2
    CROSS JOIN
        (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5) AS t3
    LIMIT 500;

**Query #1**

    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
        SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
        COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
    FROM
        orders
    GROUP BY
        order_year, order_month
    ORDER BY
        order_year, order_month;
